# Overview

For this project, I wanted to get more comfortable using JavaScript by building something small and hands-on. I focused on putting core language features into practice, like arrays, functions, DOM updates, recursion, and using a third-party library. To do that, I put together a small browser-based demo that includes a task list (shows arrays and ES6 functions) and a recursive countdown (shows recursion and error handling).

My purpose with this software was mainly to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript and how it interacts/behaves with the browser. I also added exception handling as my stretch challenge so I could get used to throwing errors and catching them cleanly.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to create the project and a web browser (Chrome/Edge) to run and test everything.  
Everything is written in standard JavaScript running in the browser, along with a third-party JS library called **dayjs**, included through a CDN link for timestamp formatting.

The project includes three files:

- `index.html` for the page structure  
- `style.css` for simple styling  
- `main.js` which contains all the JavaScript logic (arrays, DOM updates, recursion, exceptions, etc.)

# Future Work

- Add localStorage so the task list saves between refreshes  
- Add more recursive examples  
- Improve the styling and layout to make it look cleaner
