# Overview

For this project, I wanted to get hands-on experience with C#, as I haven't done so recently, and have a bit of a memory refresh on it. I decided to create a simple console-based inventory system to practice some basic concepts I've learned about previously: variables, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and inheritance. I also added file read/write so the inventory can be saved and loaded, which helped me get comfortable with working with files in C#.

My purpose in writing this software was to build confidence with the C# syntax, understand how the .NET environment works, and get a better feel for object-oriented design in this language. Building something small but complete helped me see how everything fits together.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my main editor along with the official C# extension and the .NET SDK installed on Windows.  
The project is written in C#, using only built-in libraries such as `System`, `System.Collections.Generic`, and `System.IO`.

# Future Work

- Add the ability to update or remove products  
- Add input validation and error handling  
- Expand the system to support multiple item types or categories (& utilize categorization, and perhaps SQL databases)
